                <li>Push: To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. </li>
                <li>pull requests: Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. </li>
                <li>workflows: a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. </li>
                <li>issues: Issues are suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository. </li>
                <li>raw button: opens the file in a raw form, meaning that any HTML formatting disappears </li>
                <li>blame button: used to examine the contents of a file line by line and see when each line was last modified and who the author of the modifications was. </li>
